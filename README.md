## Danny Cosson Dotfiles

My configuration files for vim, bash, and whatever else it is I use on the computer these days.  I use them both on OSX locally and on linux servers (using the bashrc\_linux file as .bashrc, without .bash\_profile)

At the moment it's configuration for bash, vim, git, tmux & screen, and some miscellaneous files (some nice programming fonts, short scripts I've found useful, etc).

### Usage

NB: Note that in gitconfig, my user is set.  So you'll want to change that to you or all your commits will have my name.  Other than that, there's nothing personally tied to me.


`./install.sh`

There are two scripts this runs:

`_make_symlinks`

which inits git submodules and symlinks the dotfiles into place. If you have existing dotfiles where they need to go, those will be moved to an `~/old_dotfiles` directory.

`osx_defaults.sh` sets a bunch of system preferences defaults in osx that I like, nothing too crazy.

If you don't want to change your system preferences, you can just run the first script `_make_symlinks`

For Vim powerline to work, you have to install a patched fonts.  Open one of the `*-Powerline.ttf` fonts in `misc/fonts/`, click install, and set that as your font in iterm or terminal or whatever.



### Dependencies

- pypi packages `pyflakes` & `pep8` for python formatting. Make sure they're on your path (if you use homebrew python, install with pip and you'll be fine).

- exuberant ctags (not the osx builtin ctags), install it with `brew install ctags`

- vim needs ruby and python support (and you probably also want clipboard, --with-features=huge, etc). See [this gist] (https://gist.github.com/dcosson/3686437) for tips compiling on osx. MacVim probably works too.
